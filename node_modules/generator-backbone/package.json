  "readme": "# Backbone.js generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-backbone.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-backbone)\n\nMaintainer: [Revath S Kumar](https://github.com/revathskumar)\n\nA Backbone generator for Yeoman that provides a functional boilerplate Backbone app out of the box. You also get access to a number of sub-generators which can be used to easily create individual models, views, collections and so on.\n\nOptional RequireJS (AMD) support has recently been added as a prompt when using the generator on new projects.\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst make a new directory, and `cd` into it:\n```\nmkdir my-new-project && cd $_\n```\n\nThen install `generator-backbone`:\n```\nnpm install -g generator-backbone\n```\n\nRun `yo backbone`, optionally passing an app name:\n```\nyo backbone [app-name]\n```\n\n\n## Generators\n\nAvailable generators:\n\n- backbone:model\n- backbone:view\n- backbone:collection\n- backbone:router\n- backbone:all\n\n\n## Options\n\n* `--skip-install`\n\n  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after\n  scaffolding has finished.\n\n* `--test-framework=[framework]`\n\n  Defaults to `mocha`. Can be switched for\n  another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.\n\n\n## Contribute\n\nSee the [contributing docs](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/contributing.md)\n\nWhen submitting an issue, please follow the [guidelines](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/contributing.md#issue-submission). Especially important is to make sure Yeoman is up-to-date, and providing the command or commands that cause the issue.\n\nWhen submitting a bugfix, write a test that exposes the bug and fails before applying your fix. Submit the test alongside the fix.\n\nWhen submitting a new feature, add tests that cover the feature.\n\n\n## License\n\n[BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)\n",
